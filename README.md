# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
## Executive summary 

Our research and design focused on how creative block will adapt scheduling applications to the needs of a variety of creatives


Through competitive analysis, we were able to pinpoint the issues similar apps had which we could change or improve upon:  
- **Cost:** Scheduling apps often cost a lot of money
- **Demographic:** They are usually tailored towards big teams and corporate environments
- **Design:** There is typically a lot of bloat in regards to tools and buttons on screen
  
Through heuristic evaluation, we evaluated our main competitor and found its strengths and weaknesses:  
- **Strengths:**
    - The aesthetics and design are **clean and simple**
    - Design patterns closely match a real world schedule/ notepad
    - The basic workflow makes good use of shortcuts/ gestures
- Weaknesses:
    - The design is **not clear to a novice user** and forces lots of trial and error
  
Using the information gathered from our research, we created personas and scenarios that addressed our users potential concerns:
- **Low cost** or free app to cater to the hobbyists and passion projects with limited funding  


Our sketches and diagrams follow designs which match these goals:  
- Simplistic **design that does not overcomplicate** small/ personal projects
- **Enough information onscreen** to give even a first time user enough to hit the ground running
