<p>Age - 42<br>
Harold is a civil engineer.  Although he is very career driven, his passion for old software and hardware is too strong for him to ignore. For the past year, he has been working on becoming a youtuber in his free time. He likes to make videos about retro consoles and computers when he’s not working. He has a wife and 3 kids. He currently has a lot on his plate, so taking on a new hobby which takes up so much time is a bit of a challenge. He really wants to see where he can take youtubing, but his main concern is being able to work on it in bite sized chunks whenever time allows.</p>
