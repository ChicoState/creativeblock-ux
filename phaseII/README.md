# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

<p>
  In Phase I, we established a strong foundation for the CreativeBlock application, but there were several areas where our report fell short. Specifically, our executive summary needed to be more concise, the competitive analysis lacked depth, and our findings section did not include specific results. In Phase II, our primary focus was to evolve our initial designs into more realistic and user-friendly wireframes. We also began collecting feedback from both software engineers and UX design peers in order to improve the overall quality and usability of our design. The ultimate goal for this phase was to refine the structure of our app and begin incorporating features that would make it feel more functional and aligned with real world expectations.

## Methods

<p>
 We used 2 research methods during this sprint: a cognitive walkthrough and informal peer feedback. The cognitive walkthrough was conducted with three students who were not part of our project team. Each student was assigned to evaluate a different group’s app design, including ours, and was asked to interact with the wireframes as if they were real users. The scenario we provided for CreativeBlock was: “You have a new idea for a project. Walk through how you’d save the idea, break it into steps, and return to it later.”<br>
 Each evaluator documented their experience, outlining the steps they took and noting any points of confusion or inefficiency they encountered. Their feedback was submitted to our team and helped us identify areas where the design could be improved. <br><br>
In addition to the walkthrough, we gathered informal feedback during a software engineering team’s classroom presentation. At the end of their demo, the presenters asked a class of approximately 35 students: “Everyone uses note-taking apps. What do you feel your note-taking apps are lacking, or what features would you like to see combined?”<br>
 The responses revealed several ideas, which we synthesized and used to guide the next iteration of our design updates.

## Findings

<p>
From the Cognitive Walkthrough,  the wireframes were received positively overall. Testers found the application easy to navigate, and most users were able to complete the assigned scenario. However, one notable piece of feedback pointed out that the application lacked a clear display of user progress, which corresponds to the usability heuristic of “Visibility of System Status.” Users were unsure if their actions such as saving ideas or updating project steps were being registered or stored by the app, which could impact their confidence in using the app.<br><br>
From the Informal Feedback,  the classroom demo responses, several useful ideas emerged. Multiple students recommended integrating a calendar to track important dates related to projects. Others suggested using tabs to separate different ideas or workspaces within the app. Several responses mentioned wanting support for AI tools to help with project ideation, such as generating or expanding content with large language models which we thought was a great idea. There was also interest in a code block input option for users who work with code, and a system for identifying related ideas.

## Conclusions
<p>
The feedback we received during this phase helped identify both strengths and key areas for improvement in CreativeBlock. Our design updates focused on improving visibility of system status by displaying a “saved at…” message while the user is typing or updating content. This real-time feedback will help reassure users that their progress is being recorded.<br><br>
In addition, we began incorporating ideas from the informal feedback into our wireframes. These updates included adding a calendar to the homepage to track deadlines, integrating tabbed navigation for organizing multiple projects or ideas, and laying the groundwork for AI-powered autocomplete suggestions to assist users during moments of creative block.<br><br>
These changes help differentiate CreativeBlock from more generic note taking apps by emphasizing functionality tailored specifically for creatives. Going forward, we plan to continue exploring features that make the app both supportive and inspiring for its users.

## Caveats

<p>
  There are several limitations to our research during this phase. The cognitive walkthroughs were conducted by us students rather than trained usability professionals, which may have introduced bias or inexperience in the evaluations just like in phase 1. Additionally, the informal feedback was gathered in a group setting from a relatively small sample size, and responses may have been influenced by peer discussion or presentation context.
