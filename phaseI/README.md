# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

<p>
  Creativeblock is a platform built to help creatives—such as content creators, software developers, and other innovators overcome moments of idea drought or burnout. By offering a clean, user-friendly interface for organizing project details, creating timelines, and saving ideas in real time, Creativeblock provides a structured and efficient way to stay motivated and on track. 
</p>

## Methods

<p>
  When doing research for Creativeblock, we performed several methods to gain a clearer understanding of what similar platforms offer and how we could improve upon them.  The first step was a competitive analysis, where we examined three different applications and noted their strengths, weaknesses, overall quality, and pricing.  <br><br>
Another research method we used was a heuristic evaluation. From our competitive analysis, the UX team selected one competitor to analyze in greater depth, focusing on how the app handles controls, visuals, user freedom, and error prevention. We chose “MinimaList” due to its well-developed, offline, yet minimal design and its alignment with our initial vision for Creativeblock. We evaluated it on a scale of 1 to 10 in areas like Visibility of System Status, Match between System and the Real World, User Control and Freedom, Consistency and Standards, Error Prevention, Recognition Rather Than Recall, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, Aesthetic and Minimalist Design, Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors, and Help and Documentation. We took notes on strengths and weaknesses for each of those categories. <br><br>
Lastly, we created personas to better understand how users might interact with Creativeblock. Each persona included detailed backstories, personalities, and goals. The UX team crafted situations in which these individuals would use or need to use Creative Block (or a similar platform), helping us design features that cater to real-world user needs and scenarios.<br><br>

## Findings

<p>
  Through our competitive analysis, we found that Creativeblock could appeal to a wide range of creators, including both hobbyists and professionals. While all these users share a desire for intuitive and efficient idea management, many also expressed interest in a cross-platform solution—allowing them to work seamlessly from any device.<br><br>
When conducting a heuristic evaluation on one chosen competitor (MinimaList), we noted that it performed moderately well in most usability categories, such as visibility of system status and consistency, but struggled with user friendliness and error prevention. Its minimalistic approach provided a streamlined user experience, however it  had little to no protection against accidental actions and since it heavily relied on finger gesture, it lacked instructions for first time users.<br><br>
Finally, personas and scenarios gave us insight into why and how different types of creators would use Creativeblock. These findings indicated the importance of simple, flexible design and efficiency, especially for busy individuals trying to balance multiple projects. Overall, the research highlighted a need for user-friendly, efficient, offline availability, that helps people manage their ideas without risk of losing data or momentum.<br><br>
</p>

## Conclusions
<p>
The UX team found that Creative Blocks’ primary users are individuals in creative fields who often struggle with idea management and motivation. To better serve this demographic, the platform should focus on simplicity and efficiency, minimizing friction in the creative process. Features like auto-saving, intuitive navigation, and structured timelines can help motivate users to stay on track without added effort.<br><br>
After developing personas and scenarios, additional features were considered to enhance the user experience, such as progress tracking and idea reminders to help users maintain momentum. Based on the heuristic evaluation, improvements in error prevention, and first time user friendliness should also be implemented, such as basic how to instruction, undo options or confirmation prompts for deletions to prevent accidental loss of ideas.<br><br>
</p>

## Caveats

<p>
  The UX team recognizes several limitations in our research. First, we do not yet have actual user data, meaning our findings are based on assumptions and competitive analysis rather than direct user feedback. Additionally, our team has limited experience conducting heuristic evaluations and persona-based research, making this our first attempt at applying these methods.<br><br>
Another challenge was defining the target audience. Since Creativeblock can be used by a broad range of creators it was difficult to deeply understand the specific needs of each group. Further user testing and real-world feedback will be necessary to refine the platform and ensure it meets the needs of its diverse user base.<br><br>
